Roopes is a Rust Object Oriented Pattern Element System.
This crate provides generic traits and implementations for typical
object-oriented patterns in Rust. It is intended to be used as a cluster of
utility classes for implementing OOP-architected executables -- *in
Rust!*

This crate provides derive-macros supporting use cases that are re-exported by roopes.
