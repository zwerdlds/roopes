- UML for aggregates
  - executable command
  - observing command
  - publisher subscriber
  - subscribing handler
- Move docs into .rs files
- Visitor from proc macro
- Documentation on builder
- Condense dependencies to workspace where possible
- Unify generics ordering (IOT vs TIO)
- Generics naming conventions
- Investigate using GATs
- builder <-> emitter
- investigate state of unit tests
- parameterized docs
- refactor builder
  - impl builder<i,o> on proc_macro version
  - investigate if builder should be emitter
  - params struct in BuilderTokenStreamBuilder
  - split up BuilderTokenStreamBuilder::build
  - Investigate the use of typestate/const enum/? in Builder pattern.
    - I think a const enum with generics in the other slots could be an implementation option here.
  - Outputted type must impl `Builder`
  - Tests
- Implement this list in kibana
- refactor visitor
  - Investigate the use of typestate/const enum/? in Builder pattern.
  - Visitor implements handler
  - add support for other types of enum structs
  - investigate adding deref on `#acceptor`
- submodules block diagram
- extends macro
- top level traits could be better as structs (simplifies boxing) - need investigation on this vs type aliasing, and manual boxing
