# Issues
- Implement patterns
  - Visitor
  - Prototype
  - Singleton
  - Adapter
    - Can it be done automatically with `delegate!`?
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Mediator
  - Momento
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
- UML for primitives
   - attachable
   - emitter
   - detachable
   - executable
   - transformer
- UML for aggregates
   - executable command
   - observing command
   - publisher subscriber
   - subscribing handler
- Docs for primitives
   - attachable
   - emitter
   - detachable
   - executable
   - transformer
- UML for aggregates
   - executable command
   - observing command
   - publisher subscriber
   - subscribing handler
- Move docs into .rs files
- Builder from proc macro
- Visitor from proc macro
- Documentation on builder
- Condense dependencies to workspace where possible
- Unify generics ordering (IOT vs TIO)
- Generics naming conventions
- Investigate using GATs
- builder <-> emitter
- investigate unit test state
- parameterized docs
- refactor builder
  - impl builder<i,o> on proc_macro version
  - investigate if builder should be emitter
  - params struct in BuilderTokenStreamBuilder
  - split up BuilderTokenStreamBuilder::build
  - Investigate the use of typestate/const enum/? in Builder pattern.
    - I think a const enum with generics in the other slots could be an implementation option here.
  - Outputted type must impl builder (lol!)
