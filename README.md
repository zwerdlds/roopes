Roopes is a Rust Object Oriented Pattern Element System.
This crate provides generic traits and implementations for typical
object-oriented patterns in Rust. It is intended to be used as a cluster of
utility classes for implementing OOP-architected executables -- *in
Rust!*

Please see the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/roopes/latest/roopes/) for details.
