Roopes is a Rust Object Oriented Programming Element System.
This crate provides generic traits and implementations for typical
object-oriented patterns in Rust. It is intended to be used as a cluster of
utility classes for implementing OOP-architected executables -- *in
Rust!*.

Please see the [crate documentation]() for details.
